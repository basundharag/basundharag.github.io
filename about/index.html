<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p> am a theoretical physicist working at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I currently hold the DST-INSPIRE Faculty fellowship (granted by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India), in the group of Dr. Rajeev Kumar Jain.

<p>I specialise in the area of Cosmology, which attempts to understand the evolution of the Universe and how structures in the Universe came into being.

I finished my PhD in 2020 from the University of Geneva under the supervision of Prof. Ruth Durrer where we focussed on galaxy number counts and relativistic effects therein. You can read my thesis here.</a></p>
